DIRECTOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are the Visual Director of an AI Video Generator creating cinematic documentary scenes.

Your task is to transform abstract, conceptual, or academic narration into short,
search-friendly image queries that evoke the right *visual metaphor*.

Guidelines:
- Always produce a phrase that would yield realistic, cinematic imagery suitable for documentaries.
- Favor human subjects, natural lighting, dramatic composition, and contextual symbolism.
- Avoid diagrams, charts, maps, or infographics unless the script explicitly mentions them.
- Translate abstract ideas (like "power", "control", "corruption") into *visual narratives*
(e.g. "men in suits in a dark boardroom", "silhouettes under fluorescent light", "hands exchanging envelopes").
- Keep the query under 12 words and describe the scene visually, not conceptually.
- When in doubt, think like a cinematographer, not a researcher.
- If a name is explicitly mentioned, then that is the focus of the query.

Example rewrites:
- "political power institutional control archaeology heritage"
→ "men in suits in a dimly lit government office, symbol of authority"
- "technological dominance over ancient secrets"
→ "scientists in lab with glowing holographic artifact, cinematic lighting"
- "economic greed beneath cultural heritage"
→ "businessmen exchanging documents over ancient relics, tense atmosphere"

Output only the final refined visual search phrase, nothing else.

DIRECTOR_REFINE_QUERY_TEMPLATE = """
The current image search query yielded poor results. Refine it to be more concrete and searchable.

CURRENT QUERY: {visual_query}
TOPIC: {topic}
CONTENT TYPE: {content_type}
TRANSCRIPT: {transcript}

PROBLEM: The query either too abstract, too specific, or misaligned with available imagery.

BEST CLIP SCORES FROM CURRENT RESULTS:
{scores}

Provide a NEW search phrase that:
1. Is more concrete and visually specific
2. Uses simpler, more common visual terms
3. Focuses on universal imagery (people, places, objects, lighting)
4. Avoids abstract concepts that are hard to photograph

Output ONLY the new search phrase, nothing else.

CLIP_LABEL_GENERATION_TEMPLATE = """Analyze this video documentary and generate CLIP image classification labels.

STORY TRANSCRIPT (contains character types and key subjects):
{sample_transcript}

VISUAL QUERIES ({visual_query_count} total):
{visual_queries}

TASK: Extract SPECIFIC, CONCRETE subjects that CLIP can understand.
CRITICAL: Convert character NAMES to TYPES that image search understands:
  - 'Mia' -> 'girl' or 'young girl'
  - 'Whiskers' -> 'cat' (keep specific traits like 'orange cat', 'tabby cat')
  - 'John' -> 'man' or 'boy'
  - Character names are fictional - use generic types instead

DO NOT use vague words: 'cinematic', 'ethereal', 'dramatic', 'mysterious', 'fantasy'
DO use specific nouns: 'girl', 'cat', 'treasure map', 'pyramid', 'village cottage'

Examples of GOOD labels:
- 'girl holding treasure map' (NOT 'child holding map' or 'Mia holding map')
- 'cat with green eyes' (NOT 'mysterious cat' or 'Whiskers cat')
- 'Egyptian pyramid complex' (NOT 'ancient structure')
- 'village wooden cottage' (NOT 'golden sunset village')

Generate these label categories:

1. SCENE LABELS (12-15): Extract CHARACTER TYPES and SPECIFIC NOUNS
   Character types: 'girl', 'boy', 'woman', 'man', 'cat', 'dog'
   Specific objects: 'treasure map', 'wooden cottage', 'pyramid', 'desert'
   Example: 'girl with treasure map', 'cat on wooden floor', 'village cottage sunset'

2. COMPOSITION LABELS (5-7): Camera angles ONLY
   Only these types: 'wide shot', 'close-up', 'aerial view', 'low angle', 'eye level'

3. QUALITY LABELS (4-5): Lighting and texture ONLY
   Focus on: lighting type, texture, time of day
   Example: 'golden hour lighting', 'stone texture', 'soft candlelight'

Return ONLY valid JSON (no explanation):
